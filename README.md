> MediaMonks - Marvel - Frontend Challenge

## Goal
The goal is to build a website that shows a list of Marvel superheroes with their respective detail pages. How you solve the design/UI is up to you.

## Have to
The app should allow client-side search by name, comics, stories, and series.
Each of the superheroes should have their own page where an image of the superhero, a list of comics, series, etc. is shown.

## What we will evaluate:
- Clean, scalable and reusable code.
- End result from a user perspective.
- Responsive.

## Bonus Points (optional):
- In the main page you can modify the information of a superhero, delete them, and save
to favorites, which must be done using localStorage so it persists when the page is
reloaded.
- Publish the page (for example github pages or vercel app) and send the link so it can be
viewed by anyone.
- Use TypeScript
